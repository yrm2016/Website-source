## Overview
<b></b>

The program of the meeting is divided in five thematic sessions:

* Session 1 : **Modern trends in quantum magnetism** <br>
  Quantum magnetism in real materials arises from the interaction at the atomic scale between spin degrees of freedom. It is at the origin of several remarkable phenomena such as unconventional superconductivity, spin waves, itinerant ferromagnetism, spin-liquid behavior, frustrated-spin systems and many more. This ever growing field has promising applications in hot technological topics such as spintronics memory storage, and quantum computation.
* Session 2 : **Phonons, vibrations and thermal properties** <br>
  The coupling between electronic and lattice degrees of freedom is at the heart of a wide range of fundamental phenomena such as, thermoelectricity, conventional superconductivity, hot carrier effects relevant, for instance, to the energy industry (storage, transmission and conversion). As the required accuracy of quantitative predictions increases with the technological progress, the reliability and physical validity of some approximations made in this field are questioned, leading to the development of more advanced yet expensive methods.
* Session 3 : **Spectroscopy and dielectric properties** <br>
  The study of the interaction between light and matter has a paramount importance from both a theoretical and technological point of view. Many of the most common spectroscopic techniques (ph1otoemission, optical absorption, inelastic X-Ray scattering) can be described theoretically by means of time-dependent DFT (TDDFT), GW approximations or by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE). The development and expansion of existing and new theories in this field is crucial to get deep insight into fundamental mechanisms at work, which may be inaccessible through other means.
* Session 4 : **Strongly correlated electrons** <br>
  In systems such as some rare earth materials, cuprates, iron pnictides and some transition metal oxides the interplay between the Pauli principal, in-site Coulomb repulsion and hopping probability within electrons of the d- or f-shells is at the basis of many outstanding phenomena such as half metallicity, metal-insulator transition, high- talk c superconductivity and spin-charge separation and more.The current theoretical approaches to describe these materials goes beyond the single-particle picture and relies on the summation of interaction diagrams up to extraordinary high order via stochastic methods (as DMFT, FCIQMC or diagrammatic Monte Carlo).
* Session 5 : **Systems in interaction with the environment** <br>
  There are many examples of complex systems where crucial processes take place in a well-defined zone (active centers) even though their dynamic is ultimately determined by the interaction with the whole surrounding environment. This is for instance the case of chemical or enzymatic reactions in biological systems, light absorption by pigments in a solvent or surface catalysis. From a theoretical perspective, the simulation of such complex systems is often achieved through methods simultaneously mixing quantum techniques (for the active site) and/or classical approaches (for the environment).

Each session will be introduced by a keynote talk.
The meeting will be opened by an introductory talk on ground-state techniques intended to introduce basic concepts common to all sessions.

A day will be dedicated to talks given by researchers from the private sector.

A non-scientific talk on gender-issue on computational science is also scheduled.
