The program is divided in five thematic sessions:

* Modern trends in quantum magnetism
* Phonons, vibrations and thermal properties
* Spectroscopy and dielectric properties
* Strongly correlated electrons
* Quantum systems in interaction with the environment

Each session will be introduced by a keynote talk. 
The meeting will be opened by an introductory talk on ground-state techniques intended to introduce basic concepts common to all sessions.

A day will be dedicated to talks given by young researchers from the private sector. 

A non-scientific talk on gender-issue on computational science is also scheduled.

The detailed program will be announced as soon as possible.
